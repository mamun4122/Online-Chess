# Online-Chess
Interfacing prject made in my university life.

We have developed a remote chess playing device by which players can achieve the enjoyment of playing chess face to face but 
sitting at a distance. We have developed a system in which we can play human vs human via internet although they are far away
from one another. There also checking after each move whether it is right or wrong.

You can find the process to build the chess board [here](/files/v1.4.pdf)
